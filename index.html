        The theme of nature in art has almost always been present whether in
        American art, Korean art, or art from any other culture. Sometimes its
        depiction can be literal or even abstract, narrowing it down to just
        colors of the natural world. Nature can be a simple add on to a painting
        to convey a sense of depth, or perspective. However, it can also be the
        main focus of a work of art. Just like nature can be recreated through
        art, it can also be used as a stand in for greater thought. A realistic
        depiction of a mountain for example can symbolize not only the sublime,
        but also curiosity for the unknown. Depictions of nature can also be
        about intellectual thought and spirituality. Art involving nature can be
        done simply to display the beauty of the natural world around us, to
        make scientific observations in an environment, or to open our minds to
        philosophical ideas about our own connection to nature and beyond. The
        philosopher Aristotle once wrote that "Art not only imitates nature, but
        it also completes its deficiencies." This can be interpreted as art not
        only recreating the natural world but also creating new ways in which to
        see it in another light. In other words, art is the missing voice of
        what nature lacks to speak.

        The belief that nature had a spiritual quality was not only present in
        American art, but Korean art as well. Nature was believed to not only be
        connected to human life, but to spirituality. Korean art not only
        depicts nature, but more specifically human experience in nature.
        Landscape painting became a reflection of the time, which was a
        dominance and growth of philosophical ideals, like Confucianism for
        example. These ideologies were built on ideals of humility and
        intellect. They were focused on being humble individuals in order to
        understand the world around them in greater depth, objectively. Art was
        a way to explore the world, beyond just human life. Their views of
        putting themselves aside were expressed in their art, where the figures
        are not as visible as the space in which they are in. The landscape is
        clearly the dominant presence in the piece, yet the addition of the
        people, although relatively small, connects nature to human life. The
        title itself, "Ten Calligraphies with Paintings Depicting Scholars
        Enjoying Quietness and Elegance in Nature", shows the human connection
        toward nature. There is a clear connection to intellect and knowledge
        within the natural world simply because they are scholars, which means
        they are highly educated in some area. Without the two scholars it might
        not be as clear of a reference. However, because there is a glimpse of
        human life, the solitude one is exposed to within nature becomes much
        more visible. Through the depiction of large mountains in the
        background, which can humble just about anyone, nature becomes a
        powerful force all on its own. (Lee, Soyoung."Religious Influence on
        Korean Art." Asia Society. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 May 2015.) -Cindy Cruz

        The Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Florida was founded by
        Margaret Acheson Stuart (1896-1980) and reflects her vision of providing
        outstanding examples of world art in an inviting, elegant setting. The
        MFA, a city landmark, opened to the public in 1965—the first art museum
        in St. Petersburg located on the downtown waterfront. From a collection
        covering almost 5,000 years of civilization in thousands of objects
        extending from antiquity to present, to fascinating traveling
        exhibitions, to exciting events in the heart of downtown’s scenic
        waterfront, the MFA is here for your discovery. The MFA is proud to have
        within its walls the only comprehensive art collection of its kind on
        Florida’s west coast. Highlights include masterpieces from Monet,
        O’Keeffe, Morisot, Wiley, and others, two gardens, and one of Florida’s
        most respected photography collections.
